# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++

## Introduction
This repository contains my personal collection of code related to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Each folder or file represents a different topic, with code that I wrote while learning and solving problems. The goal is to build a strong foundation in DSA, improve problem-solving skills, and prepare for technical interviews.

## Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Sorting and Searching
- Strings
- STL
- Linked Lists
- Recursion
- Bit Manipulation
- Stacks and Queues
- Heaps
- Backtracking
- Hashing
- Greedy
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Graph
- Dynamic Programming
- Tries
- Others...

### Status
I will keep updating this repository as I learn and implement new topics.
